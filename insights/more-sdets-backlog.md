# "We need more SDETs to handle our automation backlog." 

## This hiring strategy reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what SDETs should actually be doing. 

### The Problem: 

Most organisations hire SDETs to write automated tests - essentially turning skilled engineers into glorified script writers. I see SDETs spending their days cranking out Playwright / Cypress / Selenium scripts when they should be building the infrastructure that makes testing effortless for everyone else. 

### The Reality: 

- SDETs become bottlenecks writing tests instead of enablers building tools 
- Developers still can't easily test their code because the infrastructure doesn't exist 
- 'Manual testers' get sidelined despite having irreplaceable risk assessment skills 
- "Automation coverage" increases but actual quality problems slip through 
- Teams think they've solved testing by hiring coding SDETs, but they've just moved the bottleneck 

### A Better Approach: 

SDETs should build test infrastructure, not write tests. Their job is creating APIs, frameworks, and tooling that make it trivial for developers to test their own code. Meanwhile, skilled 'manual testers' focus on what they do best: exploratory testing, user advocacy, and intelligent risk assessment. 

The most effective SDETs I've worked with rarely write actual test cases - they build the platforms that make great testing possible for everyone. 

Has your organisation fallen into the SDET-as-test-writer trap?
