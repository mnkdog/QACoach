# Three Approaches to QA: Finding What Works for Your Context


Not all QA approaches are created equal - but each has its place. After over 25 years in quality engineering, I've seen organisations succeed (and struggle) with very different testing strategies. The key isn't finding the "perfect" approach - it's understanding which one serves your context best.
 
 
 
Here are the three main approaches I encounter, and how I help teams make each one work effectively.

### 1. Traditional Waterfall QA

**The Approach**: 
Testing as a distinct phase with dedicated QA teams validating completed development work. Think comprehensive test plans, formal documentation, and clear handoffs between development and testing.


**When It Works**: 
This approach excels when you're accepting software from third parties, working in heavily regulated environments, or dealing with fixed requirements where thorough validation is paramount. I've successfully led this approach on major system implementations where rigorous acceptance testing was essential.

**My Value**: 
I bring expertise in comprehensive test planning, risk assessment frameworks, and formal documentation that satisfies both technical and compliance requirements. The challenge is ensuring thoroughness without becoming an organisational bottleneck - something I address through strategic test prioritisation and efficient execution.


### 2. Quality Engineering (True Agile)

**The Approach**: 
QA professionals act as coaches and strategic advisors while developers own automated testing. Quality becomes everyone's responsibility, embedded throughout the development process rather than bolted on at the end.


**When It Works**: 
This is optimal for product teams practicing continuous delivery with evolving requirements. I've transformed teams using this approach, where quality thinking influences design decisions from day one.


**My Value**: 
I coach developers on testing strategy, help embed quality culture across teams, and design test architectures that support rapid, confident delivery. The challenge lies in cultural transformation and capability building - which I address through mentoring, pairing, and gradual skill transfer.


### 3. The Hybrid Reality

**The Approach**: 
Many organisations find themselves here - holding agile ceremonies like standups and sprints, but maintaining a waterfall testing mindset. Developers focus on feature delivery while separate testers validate their work in mini-waterfall cycles.


**The Reality**: 
This creates predictable problems: testing becomes a bottleneck, developers want to race ahead to new features, and feedback cycles stretch longer than they should. It's neither truly agile nor efficiently waterfall.


**My Value**: 
I help diagnose what's really happening beneath the surface processes. Sometimes the solution is gradual transformation towards quality engineering. Sometimes it's optimising the current approach to work more smoothly. I've guided teams through both scenarios, always focusing on practical improvements that deliver immediate value.


### The Right Approach for Your Context
There's no universally "correct" QA strategy. I've seen waterfall approaches deliver excellent results on complex system integrations, and I've watched quality engineering transform team effectiveness on product development. I've also helped hybrid teams work much more effectively while planning their next evolution.


The question isn't "which approach is best?" - it's "what will work most effectively for your team, your product, and your constraints right now?"
Whether you need expert test management for a critical programme, want to transform your team's quality culture, or simply need to make your current approach work better, I help organisations deliver quality software effectively.
Sometimes that means optimising what you have. Sometimes it means transformation. Always, it means understanding your context and choosing the right tools for the job.
