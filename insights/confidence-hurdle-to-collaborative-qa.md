# When shifting to collaborative QA, the biggest hurdle I've encountered isn't process - it's confidence

Many testers feel genuinely uncomfortable when first asked to:
- Join development planning meetings they've traditionally been excluded from
- Voice opinions on code that hasn't been written yet
- Question design decisions alongside senior developers
- Contribute before having a finished product to test

This discomfort creates a painful cycle: testers hesitate to speak up, miss opportunities to influence design, and quality suffers - reinforcing the outdated belief that testers should "stay in their lane."

Breaking this cycle requires deliberate action. The most successful transitions I've led involved:
- Accompanying testers to their first development meetings
- Creating explicit space for testing perspectives in planning sessions
- Celebrating early interventions that prevented defects
- Pairing testers with developers who value collaborative testing

The transformation is worth it. When testers overcome this initial discomfort, they prevent more issues upstream and become true quality consultants rather than defect reporters.

Have you experienced this hesitation when breaking down testing silos? How did you address it?
