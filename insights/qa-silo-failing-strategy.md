# Why your QA strategy might be failing despite having great testers


A common quality mistake I see isn't about tools or techniques; it's organisational.
In too many companies, QA remains a separate silo that "verifies quality" at the end of development cycles. The results are predictable:

- Last-minute bug discoveries
- Tension between developers and testers
- Quality viewed as a bottleneck
- Missed deadlines as issues cascade
- Testers overwhelmed and undervalued

The most effective quality approach I've seen embeds QA professionals as coaches within product teams, not as external gatekeepers.

In this model:

- Quality becomes everyone's responsibility
- Testing happens continuously, not just at the end
- QA professionals elevate the whole team's quality practices
- Engineers build testability into features from the start
- Release decisions are based on data, not gut feelings

The results? 
Faster delivery, better products, and QA professionals who feel genuinely valued for their expertise rather than feared for their bug reports.


Has your organization evolved beyond the QA-as-gatekeeper model?
