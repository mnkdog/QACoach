## How to Guarantee Your Developers Never Learn to Test

*A satirical guide to creating maximum dysfunction in your software delivery*


Congratulations! You've decided that developers shouldn't be trusted with testing their own code. This comprehensive guide will help you create the perfect environment where your developers remain blissfully ignorant of quality practices whilst your SDETs become overwhelmed test-writing servants.

### Step 1: Establish Sacred Separation
**Never let developers write tests for their own code.**

Create rigid job descriptions that make it clear: developers code, testers test. Post signs if necessary. When a developer asks about writing tests, remind them firmly that "we have people for that." This ensures they never develop any understanding of what makes code testable.

### Step 2: Hire an Army of Test Writers
**Recruit SDETs whose primary job is writing automation for other people's code.**

Build a separate team whose entire purpose is to figure out what the developers meant to build, then write tests accordingly. The bigger the team, the more impressive it looks on org charts. Bonus points if they sit in a different building.

### Step 3: Create the Perfect Handoff Process
**Institute a formal "code complete → testing phase" workflow.**

Nothing says professional like a proper handoff! Developers throw their code over the wall on Friday, SDETs spend Monday trying to understand what it does, then write tests based on their best guesses. The beauty is that by the time issues are found, the developers have moved on to new features and can't remember why they made those design choices.

### Step 4: Measure the Wrong Things
**Track bugs found, not bugs prevented.**

Celebrate your SDETs for finding lots of issues! Create league tables showing who caught the most defects. This incentivises late-stage bug discovery rather than early prevention. Ignore the fact that it would have been faster and cheaper to prevent these issues during development.

### Step 5: Defend the Silo at All Costs
**Resist any suggestion that developers should learn testing skills.**

When someone proposes that developers write their own tests, immediately raise concerns about "quality standards" and "separation of duties." Explain that developers can't be trusted to test their own work because they have "blind spots." Never mention that your current approach also has blind spots - different ones.

### Step 6: Create Dependency Hell
**Ensure no code can be tested without your SDET team.**

Make the test automation frameworks so complex that only your specialists can use them. When developers ask for simpler tools, explain that "enterprise-grade testing requires enterprise-grade tools." The more dependencies and setup required, the more job security for your test automation team.

### Step 7: Optimise for Impressive Demos
**Focus on test case counts rather than business impact.**

Report proudly that your team executes "10,000 automated tests every release!" Don't mention that most of them test the same happy path scenarios or that they take 6 hours to run. Stakeholders love big numbers, and slow feedback loops build character.

### Step 8: Maintain the Knowledge Monopoly
**Never share testing knowledge with developers.**

Keep your testing strategies, risk assessment techniques, and automation frameworks locked away in the testing team. When developers make design decisions that create testing nightmares, shake your head sadly and mutter about "they just don't understand quality." This maintains your position as the quality gatekeepers.

### Step 9: Perfect the Blame Game
**When releases are delayed, point fingers efficiently.**

Developers blame testers for "finding issues too late." Testers blame developers for "writing buggy code." Management blames both for "not communicating." Meanwhile, customers experience the bugs that made it through this rigorous process. Everyone stays busy, nobody improves.

### Step 10: Resist All Improvement Attempts
**When someone suggests collaborative approaches, defend the status quo.**

If anyone mentions "developers writing tests" or "quality being everyone's responsibility," immediately cite industry best practices from 2005. Explain that separation of concerns is fundamental to software engineering, conveniently ignoring that this applies to code structure, not human organisation.


### The Guaranteed Results:

Following this guide will ensure:
- ✅ Developers who design untestable code
- ✅ SDETs who become code archaeologists instead of quality coaches  
- ✅ Delayed feedback loops that make fixing issues expensive
- ✅ Knowledge silos that create single points of failure
- ✅ Testing that happens too late to influence design
- ✅ Quality shortcuts when schedules get tight
- ✅ Finger-pointing when things go wrong
- ✅ A culture where quality is "someone else's job"


### The Alternative (If You're Into That Sort of Thing):

Some misguided organisations have abandoned this proven approach in favour of:
- Developers writing tests for their own code
- QA professionals coaching rather than doing all the testing
- Shared ownership of quality outcomes
- Fast feedback loops that catch issues early
- Collaborative design sessions that consider testability

These teams report faster delivery, better quality, and higher job satisfaction. But where's the drama in that?


*Remember: If you're not creating handoffs, knowledge silos, and finger-pointing, are you even doing enterprise software development?*

**Choose your crutches wisely.**
