# Why do many testers struggle to become true quality consultants?

After years of having software "thrown over the wall" to test, they've been conditioned to be reactive rather than proactive.

The challenge:
- Testers have been trained to find problems, not prevent them
- They're accustomed to receiving finished work rather than influencing in-progress work
- Their feedback loop typically starts after development is "complete"
- They've rarely been asked for design input before coding begins

This reactive mindset creates a vicious cycle:
- Features are built without testability in mind
- Testing becomes more difficult and time-consuming
- Schedules slip and testing gets compressed
- Quality suffers and testers get blamed

Breaking this cycle requires a fundamental shift to a consulting mindset where testers:
- Proactively offer testing expertise throughout development
- Partner with developers on testability from day one
- Design test approaches alongside feature implementation
- Share ownership of quality outcomes rather than "verifying" others' work

The most successful transitions I've led involved:
- Explicitly redefining testing roles as internal consultants
- Creating opportunities for early testing involvement in planning
- Celebrating prevention of issues rather than detection
- Training testers in constructive feedback techniques

When testers embrace this consulting mindset, they shift from being perceived as project bottlenecks to becoming valued advisors.

Has your organisation made this shift? What helped your testers embrace a more consultative role?
