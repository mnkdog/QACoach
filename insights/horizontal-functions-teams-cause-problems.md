# Many companies still organise teams horizontally by function: developers build, testers verify, ops deploys

This traditional approach creates:
- Hand-off delays that extend delivery times
- Knowledge silos that block progress when key people are unavailable
- Constant context switching as teams juggle multiple projects
- Diluted ownership leading to quality shortcuts
- Endless finger-pointing when issues arise

The result? Frustration grows, delivery slows, and quality suffers.

The solution is vertical team organisation. I've seen transformative results when companies reorganise around product slices rather than technical functions.

In this model, a single team:
- Owns their product slice from concept through support
- Contains all necessary skills (dev, test, UX, etc.)
- Controls their own delivery pipeline
- Has end-to-end accountability for quality and performance

The outcome? Teams deliver faster with fewer dependencies, quality improves because everyone shares ownership, and people are more engaged because they see the full impact of their work.

Have you tried vertical team organisation? What challenges did you face in the transition?
